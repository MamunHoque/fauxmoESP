# Home Automation with NodeMCU and Alexa using fauxmoESP

This is a library for ESP8266/ESP32-based devices that emulates Philips Hue lights and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot.

The library can be found on Xose Perez's BitBucket: fauxmoESP
### Dependencies
1. [fauxmoESP Library ZIP](https://github.com/MamunHoque/fauxmoESP/blob/master/libraries/xoseperez-fauxmoesp-56183f1df105.zip?raw=true)
In order to run it in your code, you will also need 2 more libraries by Hristo Gochkov:
2. [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/MamunHoque/fauxmoESP/blob/master/libraries/ESPAsyncTCP-master.zip?raw=true)
3. [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/MamunHoque/fauxmoESP/blob/master/libraries/ESPAsyncWebServer-master.zip?raw=true)

So, Go to your Arduino IDE and install the 3 above libraries under your Arduino/Library directory.
